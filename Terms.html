  made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you don&rsquo;t
  agree to any modified terms in the Agreement, you&rsquo;ll have to stop using

  <p class="c2"></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c3">Subject to this Section 5 and Section 10 of
  these AdSense Terms, you will receive a payment related to the number of
  valid clicks on Ads displayed on your Properties, the number of valid
  impressions of Ads displayed on your Properties, or other valid events
  performed in connection with the display of Ads on your Properties, in each
  case as determined by Google. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c3">Except in the event of termination, we will
  pay you by the end of the calendar month following any calendar month in

  Services, our payments may be offset by any applicable fees for such
  Services.</span></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c3">Unless expressly authorized in writing by
  Google, you may not enter into any type of arrangement with a third party
  where that third party receives payments made to you under the Agreement or
  other financial benefit in relation to the Services.</span></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c3">Payments will be calculated solely based on
  our accounting. Payments to you may be withheld to reflect or adjusted to
  exclude any amounts refunded or credited to advertisers and any amounts
  arising from invalid activity, as determined by Google in its sole
  discretion. &nbsp;Invalid activity is determined by Google in all cases and
  includes, but is not limited to, (i) spam, invalid queries, invalid
  impressions or invalid clicks on Ads generated by any person, bot, automated
  program or similar device, including through any clicks or impressions
  originating from your IP addresses or computers under your control; (ii)
  clicks solicited or impressions generated by payment of money, false
  representation, or requests for end users to click on Ads or take other
  actions; (iii) Ads served to end users whose browsers have JavaScript
  disabled; and (iv) clicks or impressions co-mingled with a significant amount
  of the activity described in (i, ii, and iii) above.</span><span class=

  we may (a) withhold and offset any payments owed to you under the Agreement
  against any fees you owe us under the Agreement or any other agreement, or
  (b) require you to refund us within 30 days of any invoice, any amounts we
  may have overpaid to you in prior periods. &nbsp;If you dispute any payment
  made or withheld relating to the Services, you must notify Google in writing
  within 30 days of any such payment. &nbsp;If you do not, any claim relating
  to the disputed payment is waived. &nbsp;If an advertiser whose Ads are
  displayed on any Property defaults on payment to Google, we may withhold
  payment or charge back your account.</span></p>

  <p class="c4"><span class="c3">To ensure proper payment, you are responsible
  for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in
  your Account. &nbsp;You are responsible for any charges assessed by your bank
  or payment provider.</span></p>

  Google and advertisers in connection with Ads displayed on the Properties.
  &nbsp;You are responsible for all taxes (if any) associated with the
  Services, other than taxes based on Google&rsquo;s net income. &nbsp;All
